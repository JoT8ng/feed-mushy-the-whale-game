Playing the game on the web is currently work in progress!

## Getting Started:
Install requirements.txt to install correct python version and pygame (I used Python 3.11.8)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create Python Virtual Environment:
Windows Powershell Terminal:
```
python -m venv env
```

Initialize Python Virtual Environment:
Windows Powershell Terminal:
```
./env/Scripts/activate
```

Update requirements.txt:
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Start the program!
```
python main.py
```

## Inspiration!

Inspired by a cute childhood whale plushy.

### Challenges we ran into
Coding the basic logic of the game and the sprites was pretty simple. But fine tuning the collision between the player and the shark was challenging. Luckily there were many online resources available explaining how to implement pixel perfect collision between sprites! Being more familiar with Javascript and web development, getting a python virtual environment running properly and setting up the PATH was a bit challenging in the beginning.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
This is the first game that I developed!

### What we learned
Learned a lot about python classes and about pygame in general.

### What's next for Feed Mushy the Whale!
Probably adding a soundtrack and optimizing the game performance for the web.
